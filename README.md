# ResetSecuences

In general terms an automaton is a mathematical model that given an input
obtains an exit thanks to the language-dependent transition functions.
Keeping this in mind a synchronized word is a word that no matter
the state in which this, the transition functions
that are used will take you to the same state.
That is, it synchronizes the automaton from any state.


### For run
